Instructions

    Mushroom Filling: Melt butter in a medium or small non stick skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms and cook until starting to go golden on the edges – about 1 ½ minutes. Add garlic, salt and pepper, cook until golden – about 1 ½ minutes. Remove from skillet.

Omelette:

    Whisk eggs, cream, salt and pepper.
    Cool skillet and lower heat to medium.
    Add butter, then when it foams, add egg. Immediately give it a few stirs (as though you’re making scrambled eggs) then when the base just starts to set, spread it all out to cover the base (see video).
    Wait 20 – 30 seconds, then use a rubber spatula to lift up the edge, tilt pan to make the egg run off the surface under the omelette. Repeat 2 or 3 times around the edges of the omelette.
    Sprinkle half the omelette with some of the cheese, top with mushrooms, sprinkle with thyme and parsley, top with remaining cheese.
    Cover with lid and cook for 30 seconds or until the underside is light golden and top is just set – cheese won’t melt.
    Fold omelette in half to cover mushrooms, transfer to serving plate immediately – residual heat will melt cheese.
